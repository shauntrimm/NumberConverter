Welcome to Number Converter!

The goal of this application is to make converting numbers to different bases 
convenient and easy to do.

In order to convert a number, simply type it into the search box, choose the
base of the number and hit the convert button.

The accepted input characters include numeric characters, the characters
(a, A, b, B, c, C, d, D, e, E, F, f) for hex numbers equal to 10 and above, 
and - for a negative sign, which needs to always be at the 
beginning of the input. This means that commas for separating groups of
numbers such as in 1,000, which would be entered as 1000. This also means
that numbers that contain decimal places will not be accepted as input as well.

For hexadecimal based input, do not include the 0x prefix in the input string, this will
cause your input to be determined as invalid.

After conversion is complete you are free to input another number/base
combination, and the previous results will remain until you press the convert
button again.

This application supports 64-Bit Signed integers, therefore the top, and bottom
bounds for input for all types are as follows.
